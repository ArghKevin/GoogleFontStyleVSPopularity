## The Pitch

Google Fonts provides a public-access CDN for typefaces released for use without restriction on commercial use. Setting aside professional opinions on which of the typefaces are worth using, some of the typefaces are downloaded for use on web pages several million times per month. Others are hardly used. Good design isn't an exact science, however there may be tangible, technical qualities which correlate with typeface popularity.

Google Fonts provides two databases publicly. https://raw.githubusercontent.com/google/fonts/main/tags/all/families.csv provides a listing of each typeface's name; style; and weight. https://fonts.google.com/metadata/statsLinks to an external site. provides popularity statistics of each typeface, over different metrics of time. Together, these may be used to generate a graphical interface demonstrating what correlation, if any, lies between a typeface's technical qualities and actual popularity. The typefaces are downloadable from a central repository, https://github.com/google/fonts. Using the files included, lower-level properties, such as glyph count and file size, may be analyzed.

## The Plan

I've started the project two weeks late. The original criteria
specifies 24 hours of work. Over 6 weeks, that's 4 hours
per week. Below are 4-hour time allocations per week.

### Week 1

* GUI mock-up
* CRC cards
* UML
* Video explanation
* This timeline
* Start method stubs

### Week 2

* Beginning of GUI
* Start parsing CSV
* Javadoc in advance as much as is pragmatic,

### Week 3

* Start parsing JSON
* Write objects which represent each font
* Figure out API calls for file size and glyph count

### Week 4

* Start writing methods to calculate trends over time
* Line graph of top styles?
* Check documentation as it exists

### Week 5

* Update databases
* Finalize trend calculation methods
* re-structure as needed

### Week 6

* Whatever isn't done, finish it
* Demonstration video
